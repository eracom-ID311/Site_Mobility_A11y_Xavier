          The city is changing. Decades of car-centric urban planning is being
          turned on its head and a simpler, more elegant form of mobility is
          returning to the forefront: the bicycle. Dodging traffic and
          eliminating the dreaded search for parking, e-bikes have made getting
          around town easier than ever and they are only improving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bringing together modern, intuitive design, integrated features and
          unparalleled performance, one revolutionary concept and two new
          e-bikes represent the next step in urban mobility. Whether you’re
          commuting to work, pedalling to the grocery store or just going out
          for a joy ride, our designers and engineers considered every tiny
          detail to create innovative solutions that make navigating the city
          faster and simpler than ever before.

          <h2>A better more mobile future</h2>

          <p>
            Metropolitan areas are growing and with that growth comes more
            traffic, worse air pollution and greater amounts of CO² released
            into the atmosphere. In cities across the globe, officials and urban
            planners are scrambling to come up with creative ways to address
            these issues, but they need all of the help they can get. To help
            shape the future of transportation, we teamed up with the Technical
            University of Aachen to design a new and innovative solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bridging the gap between e-bike and car, our future mobility concept
            presents a revolutionary alternative to both the automobile and the
            bicycle. Combining the next generation of lightweight and powerful
            e-bike design with four-wheel stability and storm-proof protection
            from the elements, our Future Mobility Concept represents a decisive
            step in re-imagining how bicycle technology can reclaim space on the
            streets. It is a clean vehicle, a statement, and a sign of what’s to
            come.

          <h2>Bridging the gap</h2>
          <p>
            We’re so used to jumping in our cars that they often become the
            default choice, but sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic, it’s hard
            not to watch with jealousy as cyclists fly by in the bike lane. Yet
            even as the popularity of e-bikes skyrockets in urban areas, 45%* of
            potential users still want a form of transport that is protected
            from wind, rain and snow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter our Future Mobility Concept. Designed to seamlessly jump from
            the street to the bike lane, this low-emission vehicle merges the
            best parts of cars and e-bikes into one to make it the ultimate
            daily commuter. It’s fast and stable enough to fly down the open
            road, yet light and agile enough to slide into the bike lane when
            things get backed up. The next step in mobility is here.

          <h2>Capsule concept</h2>
          <p>
            How do you bring total weather protection to an e-bike? This is the
            question our designers and engineers had to answer with the Future
            Mobility Concept. The solution is a totally-sealable passenger
            compartment surrounded by an innovative, panoramic capsule that
            strikes the perfect blend of form and function.
          </p>
          <p>
            When not sealed to protect against the elements, the capsule can be
            slid forward along two rails to open the cockpit up. This ‘open
            mode’ is great when the weather is hot or if the rider wants that
            fresh-breeze feeling that comes with driving a convertible. The
            capsule even has enough space behind the rider to seat a child, load
            luggage or pack up groceries for the ride home. The capsule can then
            be slid even further forward for easy entry and exit of the vehicle.

          <h2>Design</h2>

          <p>
            Simple. Precise. Dynamic. Those three maxims have dictated the
            award-winning Canyon design language for years and now they have
            manifested in our new Future Mobility Concept. The futuristic
            aesthetic of the concept blends modern bike and automobile design,
            while the clean, reduced silhouette further communicates the
            lightweight and aerodynamic build of the vehicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, the design evokes the idea of urban simplicity and a
            newer, better way of navigating the city – just like the new
            Precede:ON e-bike. Together, they represent a unified design for a
            more mobile future.

        <p>
          Similar to a recumbent bicycle, the concept places the rider in a
          comfortable laid-back position with their feet on the pedals. The
          concept is manoeuvred using intuitive side stick steering where two
          joysticks positioned by the rider’s left and right hips turn the
          vehicle through its acute, 7-metre turning radius. The result is a
          comfortable and agile system that makes commuting safe and simple all
          while keeping the rider protected from the elements.
